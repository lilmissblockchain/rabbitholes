<br> 
<body>Below are the holes that left me researching for days, weeks to months on end. Everyday I continue to feel like a beginner, an imposter in the blockchain space. Only now, 7 years after hearing the word bitcoin that I am finding my voice in this decentralised world. My only hope is that you will take these resources and become even better than I at explaining decentralised technology to your friends, co-workers and families. The choice on whether it is good for our future is not something I can answer for you. I am hear to present my opinion on the reasources I wish I had known about.</body>
