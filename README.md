# Blockchain Rabbit Holes
Learn from my mistakes, a beginners guide to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency
<br> 
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<body> Welcome to rabbit holes, the github blog focused on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Together we will explore the rabbit holes that I have fallen down over the last few years. I hope that each condensed rabbit hole will accelerate your learning, and offer some sort of direction to your ongoing education.
<br> 
 <br> 
<h1> &#x1F407; Hello Rabbit &#x1F407;</h1> 
<br> 
<body>Below are the holes that left me researching for days, weeks to months on end. Each hole will provide and overview of my research, experience and learnings. As you fall down your own, different rabbit holes, please rememebr this space and contribute condensed holes to this project to decentralise and grow knowledge within the space.
