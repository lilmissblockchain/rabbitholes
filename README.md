# Blockchain Rabbit Holes
Learn from my mistakes, a beginners guide to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency
<br> 
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<body> Welcome to rabbit holes, the github blog focused on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Together we will explore the rabbit holes that I have fallen down over the last few years. I hope that by sharing my journey, others may be able to nagvigate the space with fewer, or at least different mistakes.

<h1> &#x1F407; Hello Rabbit &#x1F407;</h1> 
<br> 
<body>Below are the holes that left me researching for days, weeks to months on end. Every day I continue to feel like a beginner, an imposter in the blockchain space. Only now, seven years after hearing the word bitcoin that I am finding my voice in this decentralised world. My only hope is that you will become better than I at explaining decentralised technology to your friends, co-workers and families. The choice of whether it is suitable for our future is not something I can answer for you. I am here to present my opinion on the resources I wish I had from the beginning.</body>
