# Blockchain Rabbit Holes
Learn from my mistakes, a beginners guide to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency
<br> 
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<body> Welcome to rabbit holes, the github blog focused on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Together we will explore the rabbit holes that I have fallen down over the last few years. I hope that each condensed rabbit hole will accelerate your learning, and offer some sort of direction to your ongoing education.
<br> 
 <br> 
<h1> &#x1F407; Hello Rabbit &#x1F407;</h1> 
<br> 
<body>Below lies the rabbit holes which all consumed me for days, weeks and sometimes more. I have attempted to condense weeks of exploring dead ends, disasters and douches to deliver you with the real value.  
  <br>
The work presented here will not prevent you from falling down your rabbit holes; instead, I actively encourage you to go an fall down new ones and report back, by contributing your rabbit holes to this project.
  <br>
Together we can accelerate the growth of knowledge within the space.
