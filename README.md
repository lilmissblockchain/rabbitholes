# Blockchain Rabbit Holes
Learn from my mistakes, a beginners guide to blockchain technology and cryptocurrency
<br> 
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<body> Welcome to rabbit holes, the github blog focused on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Together we will explore the rabbit holes that I have fallen down over the last few years. I hope that by sharing my journey, others may be able to nagvigate the space with fewer, or at least different mistakes.

<h1> &#x1F407; Hello Rabbit &#x1F407; </h1> 
Below are the holes that left me researching for days, weeks to months on end. Everyday I continue to feel like a beginner, an imposter in the blockchain space. Only now, 7 years after hearing the word bitcoin that I am finding my voice in this decentralised world. Today I know more about what I think, and I am not so afraid to have friendly debate with self proclaimed "experts" in the space.
